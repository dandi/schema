description: 'A challenge for data sharing in systems neuroscience is the multitude
  of different data formats used. Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology 2.0 (NWB:N)
  has emerged as a standardized data format for the storage of cellular-level data
  together with meta-data, stimulus information, and behavior. A key next step to
  facilitate NWB:N adoption is to provide easy to use processing pipelines to import/export
  data from/to NWB:N. Here, we present a NWB-formatted dataset of 1863 single neurons
  recorded from the medial temporal lobes of 59 human subjects undergoing intracranial
  monitoring while they performed a recognition memory task. We provide code to analyze
  and export/import stimuli, behavior, and electrophysiological recordings to/from
  NWB in both MATLAB and Python. The data files are NWB:N compliant, which affords
  interoperability between programming languages and operating systems. This combined
  data and code release is a case study for how to utilize NWB:N for human single-neuron
  recordings and enables easy re-use of this hard-to-obtain data for both teaching
  and research on the mechanisms of human memory.'
